Welcome to PyStar!
=========================================================

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach all women (including trans women) and their friends who are 
looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek environment.  The material on this site
builds on `Boston Python Workshop <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_workshop>`_ which 
was held March 4/5, 2011. 

If you would like to hold a PyStar workshop in your area using this material, please get in touch by
