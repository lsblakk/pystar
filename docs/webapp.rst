Intro to Programming Python: Web App
=============================================

This tutorial will look at writing and deploying a web application. 
The app is an online poll where visitors can view choices
(a bit of text) and vote the option up and down.

We will cover local deployment as well as deploying your web application to the world,
where other people can play with it, and where you can modify it.

This is based *heavily* on the official tutorial for the Django web programming framework
as well as the `Ruby on Rails for Women <http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Ruby_and_Rails_workshops_for_women>`_
workshop.

If you would like to see an example of this completed tutorial, 
`Gregg did it <https://github.com/gregglind/pystar-webapp/commits/master>`_, 
`Lukas did it <https://github.com/lsblakk/myproject>`_


Part 1: If You Build It... They Will Pay You
================================================


The Client
-------------

VoteOnEverything, Ltd. (VOEL) is a web startup hoping to make some money on this
"internet" thing the kids are talking about.  Their idea: **an app where people
can easily create polls on their favorite subjects and vote on them!** 
They are flush with cash, and have hired you (you're smart, right?) to help out!

Example User Stories
---------------------

#. As a *poll creator*, it should be obvious and easy to create polls.
#. As a *visitor*, I want stable urls so I can share my polls easily.
#. As a *voter*, it should be easy to vote on polls!
#. As *VOEL*, I want polls with lots of total votes to be on the front page.
#. As *VOEL*, I want to keep track of visitor information, to sell to advertisers,
   including their source ip, geography, etc.
#. As a *user*, I want the application to keep track of polls I have created,
   my voting history.
#. (many many more)

Designing The Prototype
------------------------

Time to make a prototype!
After hearing about Python and the Django web framework from that 
smart woman you know who works at Google, you have decided to try it out!

Since this is a prototype, you have decided to eliminate some features
(logins, history tracking, demographic information, etc.) to focus on the 
core applicaion:  polls and voting.


The prototype will consist of two parts:

#. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
#. An admin site that lets you add, change and delete polls.

You have decided to implement the following pages:

#. Poll “index” page – displays the latest few polls.
#. Poll “detail” page – displays a poll question, with no results but with a form to vote.
#. Poll “results” page – displays results for a particular poll.
#. Vote action – handles voting for a particular choice in a particular poll.

To support these pages, you need these abstractions (models, objects):

#. Polls
#. Choices



Part 2: Create your Django App
=======================================

Goal:  Configure and explore a basic Django "out of the box app".


Create necessary directories, activate virtualenv
----------------------------------------------------

(You may have already done this!)

In your terminal, starting from somewhere reasonable (here, ``mydir``)

.. code-block:: bash
    
    # remember in bash, # means comment -- don't type these :)
    cd mydir
    mkdir django_projects
    virtualenv --no-site-packages pystar
    # New python executable in pystar/bin/python
    # Installing setuptools............done.
    source pystar/bin/activate  # windows -> pystar\Scripts\activate.bat 
    # (pystar)My-MacBook-Pro:mydir $ 
    # $ ls .
    # django_projects pystar
    

Switch to the right directory
-------------------------------------------

In a terminal (or GitBash), get into the ``django_projects`` directory 
we created in the Friday setup portion of the tutorial. 

You can do that by typing this into your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd django_projects


In the Friday setup portion of the workshop, you already saw how 
to use the ``django-admin.py`` command to start a project. 
Let's go into it and start looking around.

.. code-block:: bash

    django-admin.py startproject myproject # if you haven't already got a my_project
    cd myproject

Look at the files
-------------------------

Let’s look at files in the project (you can ignore any .pyc files). The default Django app should
look like this:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    # remember, '$ ' indicates the terminal prompt, don't type it!
    $ ls
        __init__.py
        manage.py
        settings.py
        urls.py

These files are:

* ``__init__.py``: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python module. Because of the ``__init__.py`` file, you can use ``import`` to ``import myproject``.
* ``manage.py``: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about ``manage.py`` in ``django-admin.py`` and ``manage.py``.
* ``settings.py``: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.
* ``urls.py``: The URL declarations for this Django project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.

Start the Development (Local) Server
-------------------------------------

#. Verify the development server will start. 
    
    a)  Run the command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            python manage.py runserver

    b) Review the output in your terminal.  It should look similar to:

        .. code-block:: bash

            Validating models...
            0 errors found.
            
            Django version 1.2, using settings 'myproject.settings'
            Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
            Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

      .. note: 
        
        You've started the Django development server, a lightweight web server written in 
        Python. The Django maintainers include this web server, but on a "deployment" like 
        http://alwaysdata.com/, you typically tie Django into an existing server like Apache.

#.  Now that the server's running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your Web browser. 
    You'll see a "Welcome to Django" page, in pleasant, light-blue pastel. It worked!

    .. image:: images/itworks.png

    Note how mouthy this is, and that it mentions ``DEBUG``, ``settings.py``, and
    a lot more, which will be covered in later sections.  

    ::

        Of course, you haven't actually done any work yet. Here's what to do next:
        If you plan to use a database, edit the DATABASES setting in myproject/settings.py.
        Start your first app by running python myproject/manage.py startapp [appname].
        You're seeing this message because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings 
        file and you haven't configured any URLs. Get to work!


#.  Observe the logging that happens in the terminal where your server is running:

    ..  code-block:: none

        [24/Mar/2011 11:50:18] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2057
    
    which has the format:

    ..  code-block:: none

        DATE  METHOD URL  PROTOCOL  RESPONSE_CODE  CONTENTSIZE

#.  Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/some/url/.  What changes in the 

#.  Exit the server 

    #. return to the terminal instance where the development server is running
   
    #. pressing CONTROL-C on your keyboard

    #. VERIFY your server is shut down.  How do you do this?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_verify_shutdown>`]

#.  **Experiment**:  These two commands are identical:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py runserver 
        python manage.py runserver 8000

    *Start* a server on port 8103, and *navigate* to it using your browser
    [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_8103>`].

#.  Type ``python manage.py help``.  Speculate what some of these commands 
    might do.  cf:  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/


Part 3: Save your work!
=======================================

Before we do anything else, let's save our work and start it with the world.

We'll do that with ``git`` and ``Github``. On your own computer, get to a Terminal or a GitBash.

#.  You should have set up ``git`` and your GitHub account yesterday. If not,
    do it now.

#.  ``cd`` to get into the ``myproject`` directory. If it's a fresh Terminal, this is what you'll do:

    .. code-block:: bash

         cd ~/django_projects/myproject

#.  Is this new project?  (It is!)  So:

    #. create a git repository in the project directory:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # in myproject
            git init

    #.  Tell git to ignore any files that end with .pyc (why?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_pyc_files>`]) when we push
        to our repo .  Add an exclude rule to ``.git/info/exclude``:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # in myproject directory
            gedit .git/info/exclude
            
            # add this line to the end of the file
            # excludes all compiled python files, which aren't interesting.
            .pyc

    #.  Create your project on GitHub.  Go to http://github.com/ and create a new repository called "myproject". On the main dashboard page, click on "New Repository" fill out the necessary information. cf:  http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/.

#.  Check the **status** of your files.  At this point:

    .. code-block:: bash

        (pystar2)Gregg-Linds-MacBook-Pro:myproject gregg$ git status
        # On branch master
        #
        # Initial commit
        #
        # Untracked files:
        #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        #
        #	__init__.py
        #	manage.py
        #	settings.py
        #	urls.py
        nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

    None of the files are **tracked**.  That is, ``git`` doesn't know about them!

#.  Add one file ``git add manage.py``.  **POP QUIZ**:  What does ``git status`` say now?

#.  Add all your files to the repo, in the local directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git add *.py   # all .py files, using a wildcard match.

    Now git is aware of your files.  Use ``git status`` to see them there in
    the *staging* area (the index).

#.  ``git commit`` to ``commit`` those files:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # -m -> what is the 'message' for the commit
        git commit -m "Initial commit of django project from the PyStar workshop"

    Look at your changes with  ``git log`` to see your history.  Is your commit message there?


#.  Connect the remote github repo to your local one, and use ``git push`` to push those up to your Github repository (putting your user name and project title in the appropriate slots):

    .. code-block:: bash

        git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/myproject.git
        git push origin master

#.  Go to your Github account in your browser. Find the ``myproject`` repository. Do you see your files?

#.  Remember:

    - "commit your work" means "add and commit it to the local repository
    - "push your work" means "git push it to github"


Part 4:  Configure your Django Project
========================================

Now that we have a the scaffolding for our **project** in place, we can get to 
work!  It needs to be **configured**.

Fix security settings
------------------------------------

Right now, everyone in the workshop has the same "SECRET_KEY". Since Django 
uses this key for various sensitive things, you should change it.

#. Open  ``settings.py`` in your editor.  ``settings.py`` is a Python script that only contains variable definitions.  Django looks at the values of these variables when it runs your web app.

#. Find the variable named ``SECRET_KEY`` and set it to whatever string 
   you want. 

#. Verify it looks something like:

    .. code-block:: python

        # change this to something arbitrary.
        SECRET_KEY = '6yl8d1u0+ogcz!0@3_%au)_&ty$%1jcs2hy-!&v&vv2#@pq^(h'

#. How would we put a single-quote (\') in our SECRET_KEY?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_single_quote>`]

#. save the file.

#. git add and commit it:

    .. code-block bash:

        git add settings.py
        git commit -m "changed SECRET_KEY"


Set up the Database
------------------------

#.  Keep looking at ``settings.py``: The ``DATABASES`` variable is a dictionary 
    (note the '{}' characters) with one key: ``default``.

    .. code-block:: python

        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
                'NAME': '',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
                'USER': '',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
                'PASSWORD': '',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
                'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for 127.0.0.1. Not used with sqlite3.
                'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
            }
        }

#.  Notice that the value of ``default`` is itself another dictionary with information about the site's default  database. We're going to set our app to use a ``sqlite`` database.
    Sqlite is great for development because is stores its data in one normal file on 
    your system and therefore is really simple to move around with your app.

    ..  note::

        In production, Sqlite has issues because only one process can *write* to it
        as a time.  **Discuss** the implications of this with your group.  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_sqlite_one_writer_implications>`]

#.  Edit the lines in your settings.py to match the lines below:

    .. code-block:: bash

        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
        'NAME': 'database.db', 

    The ``NAME`` key tells the Django project to use a file called ``database.db`` to store information for this project.

#.  **Pop quiz**: Does ``database.db`` exist right now?  Find out!  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_database_db_exists>`]

#.  Notice the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting towards the 
    bottom of the ``settings.py``. That variable (a tuple... note the '()' symbols) 
    holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. 
    **Apps** can be used in multiple projects, and you can 
    package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.  

    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.sites',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
            # 'django.contrib.admin',
            # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
            # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
        )

    What do you think these various **apps** do?  Why does it make sense
    for them to come in a standard configuration?  
    [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_django_standard_apps>`]

#.  Each of these applications makes use of at least one database table, so we need to create 
    the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py syncdb

    The syncdb command looks at the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and creates any necessary 
    database tables according to the database settings in your ``settings.py`` file. You'll see a 
    message for each database table it creates.

#.  When prompted, you'll get a prompt asking you if you'd like to create a superuser account for the authentication system. Say yes!  Use 'super' as your password::

        You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
        Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes
        Username (Leave blank to use 'barack'): super
        E-mail address: super@super.com
        Password: 
        Password (again): 
        Superuser created successfully.
        Installing index for auth.Permission model
        Installing index for auth.Group_permissions model
        Installing index for auth.User_user_permissions model
        Installing index for auth.User_groups model
        Installing index for auth.Message model
        Installing index for polls.Choice model
        No fixtures found.


#.  Does this seem magical?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_django_magical>`]


#.  **Pop quiz**: Does ``database.db`` exist right now?  Find out!  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_database_db_exists_after_sync>`]

#.  Save *and commit* your work (don't save ``database.db`` -- 
    why not?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_why_not_save_database_db>`])::

        git status 
        # will show settings.py is changed, and a new 'untracked' 
        # MacBook-Pro:myproject gregg$ git status
        # On branch master
        # Changed but not updated:
        #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        #
        #	modified:   settings.py
        #
        # Untracked files:
        #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        #
        #	database.db
        # file 'database.db'

#.  Drink some tea and take a stretch break.  Then we can come back to 
    STRETCHING OUR MINDS.


Part 5: In Which You Save You From Yourself, Using Git.
=========================================================

Your work is saved and commited (in git!) right?

**Right?**  How do you know?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_know_what_saved>`]

Good. Because you got a case of the accidental deletes and you've deleted your ``settings.py`` file!

#.  No really. Go and delete ``settings.py``. Throw it in the trash. Or the recycling bin. Or ``rm`` from the command line.  Make sure it's *really gone* using ``ls``.

#.  Try running your dev server. What happens? Why?

#.  Delete ``settings.pyc``. Try running your dev server. What happens now? Why?  
    [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_dev_server_still_works>`]

#.  Cry!  So they're gone right? No way back. And everything's broken!

#.  Rejoice! Because we're using version control and version control is about to save your bacon!

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git checkout settings.py

#.  Look at your project folder again, using ``ls``. Lo and behold, ``settings.py``! Back from beyond the grave! Cool, huh? Open it up, and verify it is exactly as you left it.  Isn't that magical?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_git_magical>`].

    But what of ``settings.pyc``? Start your dev server. It works, right? Stop your dev server and look at the files in your project. Do you see ``settings.pyc``? How did it get there?  [:ref:`answer  <webapp_answers_why_only_restore_py_not_pyc>`]



Part 6: Build The Polls Application
========================================

Now that your environment -- a "project" -- is set up, you're set to start building the poll application.

Each application you write in Django consists of a Python package, 
somewhere on your Python path, that follows a certain convention. 
Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory 
structure of an app (that Django expects), so you can focus on writing code!.

Projects and Apps
---------------------------------

We've talked a little about Django **apps** and **projects**. You might be 
wondering what the difference is.

Here are the things to know:

* An **app** is component of a website that does something. For example, the **Django administration** app is something you'll see later in this tutorial.  So is our ``polls`` app.  An app is:

    * single purpose - login, passwords, polls, forum, etc.
    * orthonogal to / independent of other apps - polls shouldn't have to
      know the inside details of authentication, for example.

* A **project** corresponds to a 'website': it contains a ``settings.py`` file, and 
  it may have corresponding databases or other data stores
  that the apps interact with.

Django apps can live anywhere on the **Python path**.  The **python path** is 
a list of paths where the python interpreter looks for modules.  

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path
    ['', '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python2.6/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg', 
    '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pip-0.8.3-py2.6.egg', 
    '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python26.zip', 
    '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python2.6', 
    '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python2.6/plat-darwin', 
    '/Users/gregg/mydir/pystar/lib/python2.6/plat-mac' ... ]


To be importable (seeable by Python), your Django app must be in one of the folders
on *your* path.  

**Experiment**:  look at your Python Path!


Create The Poll App
---------------------

In this tutorial, we'll create our poll app in the myproject directory for 
simplicity. In the future, when you decide that the world needs to be able to 
use your poll app and plug it into their own projects, and after you determine
that your app plays nicely with other apps, you can publish that directory separately!


#.  open your terminal and navigate to ``myproject``
#.  make scaffolding for the app

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py startapp polls

    That'll create a directory ``polls`` to house the poll application.

#.  Verify what is new.  

    .. code-block:: bash

        git status
        # should show 'polls/' in 'untracked'
        

#.  While were are here lets make ``git`` ignore 'database.db' by adding
    ``database.db`` to ``.git/info/exclude``.  Verify (using 'git status') that is it gone.

#.  Examine the layout of ``polls`` (we will do more of this in following sections).

    ..  code-block:: bash

         # remember not to type the '$', it just means the prompt'.  
         $ ls polls
         polls/
            __init__.py
            models.py
            tests.py
            views.py

#.  Prove that ``polls`` is importable [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_is_polls_importable>`]

#.  Add and commit ``polls/*py``.  


#.  Install the polls app into the project.   
    Edit the ``settings.py`` file again, and change the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to 
    include the string 'polls' as the last entry.  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_added_polls>`]

#.  Save and commit the  ``settings.py`` file.

#.  Refill your tea!



Part 7: Test your Django Project 
=======================================

#.  Run the default Django tests

    ..  code-block:: bash

        python manage.py test

#.  Examine the output.  If there are errors, what are they?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_django_project_testing_results>`]

#.  Run the tests for the ``polls`` application

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py test polls

    You should get output like:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ python manage.py test polls
        Creating test database for alias 'default'...
        .
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ran 1 test in 0.001s
        
        OK
        Destroying test database for alias 'default'...

#.  Make it louder!  Run ``python manage.py test polls -v 2`` and see that it 
    now *names* the test --> ``test_basic_addition (polls.tests.SimpleTest)``.  
    '-v' is for *verbosity*, and (here) can be 0,1,2,3.  

#.  View ``polls/test.py``, and see the example test.

#.  Copy :download:`test_polls.py` and move it into ``polls`` directory 

#.  Edit ``polls`` to include the tests from ``test_polls.py`` to look like:

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.test import TestCase
        from test_polls import *


#.  Add it into your project code git repo:

    ..  code-block:: bash
        
        git add polls/tests.py polls/test_polls.py
        git commit -m "added tests"

#.  Examine ``test_polls.py`` in your editor.  This file (provided by us)
    gives acceptance tests for many of the points on the original spec sheet.  Normally
    this is the sort of thing you would write yourself, after reading your 
    spec, and deciding on acceptence criteria.  We done it here to help you
    along, and provide an example for your work in the future!

    Writing good tests *is hard*!

#.  Re-run your tests.  ``python manage.py test polls``. Note that most fail! 
    (We will assume that the django tests all pass and focus on testing the 
    ``polls`` tests, from here on out.)

#.  Discuss with your groups why testing matters.  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_why_testing_matters>`]

#.  We will return to testing throughout this document as we add new features.
    We are done when all the tests pass!

#.  Further research:  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/, which
    goes into this in much greater detail.

Part 8: Refine Your Workflow!
==================================

When developing, this is a good work flow.  

1.  Design a feature, with criteria for acceptance.
2.  Test your feature, to see if meets those criteria.
3.  When it works (or you make good progress), *commit your work*.

We will use this workflow throughout the following sections, as we add
the features that our protype spec outlined.


Part 9: Philosphy Break!
===========================

In the following sections, there will be **Django Philosophy** breaks to 
highlight major ideas of the Django framework.  Other web
frameworks might make these choices or use these terms differently.  Who is right?
[:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_the_right_framework>`]



Part 10: Mockups, Views, and URLs
===================================================================


..  admonition:: Django-Philosophy

    A view is a “type” of Web page in your Django application that 
    generally serves a specific 
    task and has a specific associated template. 

In a Blog application, you might have the following views:

* Blog homepage – displays the latest few entries.
* Entry “detail” page – permalink page for a single entry.
* Year-based archive page – displays all months with entries in the given year.
* Month-based archive page – displays all days with entries in the given month.
* Day-based archive page – displays all entries in the given day.
* Comment action – handles posting comments to a given entry.

In our poll application, we’ll have the following four views:

* Poll “index” page – displays the latest few polls.
* Poll “detail” page – displays a poll question, with no results but with a form to vote.
* Poll “results” page – displays results for a particular poll.
* Vote action – handles voting for a particular choice in a particular poll.

In Django, each view is represented by a Python function.

Design your URLs 
---------------------------

The first step of writing views is to design your URL structure. You do this by creating a 
Python module, called a ``URLconf``. ``URLconfs`` are how Django associates a given URL with 
given Python code.

When a user requests a Django-powered page, the system looks at the ``ROOT_URLCONF`` 
setting, which contains a string in Python dotted syntax. 

**Pop quiz**: what is the ``ROOT_URLCONF`` for your project?  [:ref:`answer  <webapp_answers_root_urlconf>`]

Django loads that module and looks for a module-level variable called ``urlpatterns``, which is a sequence of tuples in the 
following format:

.. code-block:: bash

     (regular expression, Python callback function [, optional dictionary])


Django starts at the first regular expression and makes its way down the list, comparing 
the requested URL against each regular expression until it finds one that matches.

You might ask, "What's a regular expression?" Regular expressions are patterns for matching 
text. In this case, we're matching the URLs people go to, and using regular expressions to 
match whole 'groups' of them at once.

(If you'd like to learn more about regular expressions read the 
`Dive into Python guide to regular expressions <http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/index.html>`_ sometime. 
Or you can look at this `xkcd <http://xkcd.com/208/>`_.)

In addition to **matching** text, regular expressions can **capture** text. 
**Capturing** means to `remember` that part of the string, for later use.
Regexps (or Regexen) use parentheses ``()`` to wrap the parts they're capturing.

For Django, when a regular expression matches the URL that a web surfer requests, 
Django extracts the captured values and passes them to a function of your choosing. 
This is the role of the ``callback function`` above.  When a regular expression
matches the url, Django calls the associated ``callback function`` with any 
**captured** parts as parameters.  This will much clearer after the next section.

Add URLs to urls.py
------------------------

When we ran ``django-admin.py startproject myproject`` to create the project, 
Django created a default URLconf. Take a look at ``settings.py`` for this line:

.. code-block:: bash

 ROOT_URLCONF = 'myproject.urls'

That means that the default URLconf is ``myproject/urls.py``.

#.  Write our URL mapping. Edit the file ``myproject/urls.py`` so it looks like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^polls/$', 'polls.views.index'),
            (r'^polls/(\d+)/$', 'polls.views.detail'),
            (r'^polls/(\d+)/results/$', 'polls.views.results'),
            (r'^polls/(\d+)/vote/$', 'polls.views.vote'),
            # Examples:
            # url(r'^$', 'myproject.views.home', name='home'),
            # url(r'^myproject/', include('myproject.foo.urls')),

            # Uncomment the admin/doc line below to enable admin documentation:
            # url(r'^admin/doc/', include('django.contrib.admindocs.urls')),

            # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
            # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        )

#.  **POP QUIZ**, suppose a visitor goes to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/23/results/ , 

    #. which regex pattern is tripped?
    #. what function is then called?
    #. what arguments is that function called with?
    #. [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_urlconf_polls_vote>`]

#.  Save ``urls.py``.

#.  Start the dev server and try that url out!  What happens?

#.  Re-run the test suite ``python manage.py test polls``.  
    What parts (if any) pass now that didn't before?  You should be
    seeing lots of "ViewDoesNotExist" messages.  (We will create them
    in the next section.  The tests will much more sensible after that!

#.  Save and commit.

#.  Review:  When somebody requests a page from your Web site 
    -- say, "/polls/23/", Django will load the ``urls.py`` Python module, because it's 
    pointed to by the ``ROOT_URLCONF`` setting. It finds the variable named ``urlpatterns`` 
    and traverses the regular expressions in order. When it finds a regular expression that 
    matches -- ``r'^polls/(\d+)/$'`` -- it loads the function ``detail()`` from 
    ``polls/views.py``. Finally, it calls that module's ``detail()`` function like so:

    .. code-block:: bash

        detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, '23')

    The '23' part comes from ``(\d+)``. Using parentheses around a pattern "captures" the
    text matched by that pattern and sends it as an argument to the view function; the
    ``\d+`` is a regular expression to match a sequence of ``digits`` (i.e., a number).

#.  Does this seem magical?  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_django_magical>`]
    Actually, this is less magical than some other parts of Django!  Regular Expressions,
    though sometimes cryptic, are a pretty common and useful skill among developers.

#.  The *idea* that a URL doesn't have to map onto a file, or some other sort
    of static resource, is quite powerful.  The URL is just a way of giving
    instructions to some server, somewhere.
    
    (**Rant**:  In Django, as in most modern frameworks, you have total control
    over the way your URLs look. People on the web 
    won't see cruft like .py or .php at the end of your URLs.  There is no
    excuse for that kind of stuff in the modern era!)

#.  Exercise:  Think about another hypothetical website, "MyMagicToa.st", in which you use
    a virtual toaster.  What might some actions and (and associated urls) 
    be for interacting with it?



Write Some Views!
-----------------------------------------

#.  Start the development server:  ``python manage.py runserver``

#.  Fetch "http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/" in your browser. 
    You should get a pleasantly-colored error page with the following message:

    .. code-block:: none

        ViewDoesNotExist at /polls/

        Tried index in module polls.views. Error was: 'module'
        object has no attribute 'index'

#.  Recall this line ``(r'^polls/$', 'polls.views.index')``.

#.  Explore this using your django-shell:  ``python manage.py shell``

    ..  code-block:: python
        
        >>> import polls         # imports fine!       
        >>> import polls.views   # imports fine also!  polls/views.py
        >>> dir(polls.views) # what is in there!
        >>> 'index' in dir(polls.views)
        False
        >>> import inspect
        >>> inspect.getsourcefile(polls.views)
        # something like
        '/Users/adalovelace/gits/myproject/polls/views.py'
    
    So, a mystery?  Where is the view!?  It's nowhere!  The URL parsing is going
    fine, but there is no one listening at the other end of the phone!
    This ``ViewDoesNotExist`` error happened because you 
    haven't written a function ``index()`` in the module polls/views.py.

    Try http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/23/,  http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/23/results/ and   
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/23/vote/, and you
    will see similar messages. 
    The error messages tell you which view Django tried 
    (and failed to find, because you haven't written any views yet).

#.  Write some views. Open ``polls/views.py`` and put the following Python code in it:

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.http import HttpResponse
     
        def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the poll index.")

    This is a very simple view. 

#.  Save the views.py file, then go to http://127.0.0.1/polls/ in your
    browser, and you should see that text.

#.  RE-RUN YOUR TESTS.  **POP QUIZ**.  Do more pass?  

#.  Add a few more views by adding to the ``views.py`` file. These views are slightly 
    different, because they take an argument (which, remember, is passed in from whatever 
    was captured by the regular expression in the URLconf):

    .. code-block:: python

         # recall or note that %s means, "subsitute in a string"

         def detail(request, poll_id):
             return HttpResponse("You're looking at poll %s." % (poll_id,))
         
         def results(request, poll_id):
             return HttpResponse("You're looking at the results of poll %s." % (poll_id,))
         
         def vote(request, poll_id):
             return HttpResponse("You're voting on poll %s." % (poll_id,))

#.  Save ``views.py``. 

#.  Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/34/. It'll run the 
    ``detail()`` method and display whatever ID you provide in the URL. 
    Try http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/34/results/
    and http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/34/vote/ too -- 
    these will display the placeholder results and voting pages.

#.  Add a little html to the 'results' view.  Wrap the poll_id in ``<strong> </strong>``
    tags and **verify** that the view is indeed bold!

#.  RE-RUN YOUR TESTS.  **POP QUIZ**.  Which ones now pass?

#.  Add and commit your code.  Remember to write a good commit message that 
    mentioned what changed (in English) and more details below.  Mention 
    which tests now pass (hint, they are 'reachability' tests!)


Mockery, Mockery
--------------------

These views don't plug into *real* polls.  This is by design.

* front-end (visual) and back-end (data) can happen simulatenously
* demonstrating the UI of the product shouldn't rely on having full data in
  the back end.

All of this relies on the frontend and backend having a concensus view
of the **interface** between them.  What does a 'Poll' look like?  What data
and methods might it have?  If we knew this, we could construct **mock objects**
and work with them, instead!  Keeping objects simple makes writing interfaces
between different layers of the application stack easier.

We will come back to templates (and use Django's build-in templating facilities
rather than simple python string formatting) after we build some models.



Part 11:  Showing Off!
=========================

Time to show our work to the world.  To do this, we are going to use DjangoZoom,
a fairly new site that makes doing remote deployment easy!  It's still in beta,
and we are going to be guinea pigs for them!

#.  Push your code to github

#.  Go to:  http://djangozoom.com/dz2/dashboard/

    #.  Login with the credentials given in class.

    #.  Enter your GitHub url.

        .. image:: images/djangozoom1.png

    #.  Rename your project.

        .. image:: images/djangozoom2.png

    #.  Navigate to the URL you eventually get, like  http://p00000058.djangozoom.net/.

    #.  OHNOES!  There is no slash (root) view!

        .. image:: images/djangozoom_noindex.png

    #.  See that '/polls/' looks just like how it does on your local machine.

#.  Fix that locally!  

    #.  in ``urls.py`` add:

        .. code-block:: bash 

            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                (r'^$', 'polls.views.redirect_to_polls'),
                (r'^polls/$', 'polls.views.index'),

    #.  in ``polls/views.py``:

        from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

        def redirect_to_polls(request):
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/polls/')

#.  Restart your local server, and hit http://127.0.0.1/ .  
    What happened?  Look at your logging:

    .. code-block:: bash

        [24/Mar/2011 15:01:15] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 302 0
        [24/Mar/2011 15:01:15] "GET /polls/ HTTP/1.1" 200 39

    See the '302'?  By returning a ``HttpResponseRedirect``, 
    you **redirected** the user to a different page!  Learn more about status
    codes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes .

#.  Commit and push your changes.

#.  Return to DjangoZoom and rebuild.

    .. image:: images/djangozoom_build.png 

    Your redeployed site should have a sensible '/' (that redirects to ``/polls``).


Takeaways:

-   pushing to remote location exposed that having the '/' behaviour unspecified
    is a little ugly.  This should be added to the spec.  
-   redirects can hide a multitude of sins.  If you are used to Apache ModRewrite,
    doing it from right in your framework can be a lot easier!


Part 12: Poll and Choice Models
========================================

Remember those files from **Create The Poll App** above?  
We have worked with ``views.py`` and ``test.py``.  Let's tackle ``models.py`` 
next and make some actual data for our views to see!

..  admonition:: Django-Philosophy

    A model is the single, definitive source of data about your data.
    It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing. 
    Django follows the DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") Principle. The goal is to 
    define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

    (If you've used SQL before, you might be interested to know that each 
    Django ``model`` corresponds to a SQL ``table``.  This simple correspondence
    between models and tables is a design choice, and not everyone likes it. [:ref:`discussion <webapp_answers_no_like_django>`])

In our simple poll app, we'll create two models: ``Polls`` and ``Choices``.  As per our 
spec from the customer:

* A poll has:
    
    * a question
    * a publication date. 

* A choice has two fields:
    
    * the text of the choice 
    * a vote tally. 

Each ``Choice`` is associated with a ``Poll`` and each ``Poll`` has associated ``Choices``. 
We will respesent these concepts with python classes derived from ``django.db.models``.

#. Edit the ``polls/models.py`` file so it looks like this:

    .. code-block:: python

         from django.db import models
         
         class Poll(models.Model):
             question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
             pub_date = models.DateTimeField()
         
         class Choice(models.Model):
             poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)
             choice = models.CharField(max_length=200)
             votes = models.IntegerField()

#. Save the ``models.py`` file.

All models in Django code are represented by a class that subclasses 
``django.db.models.Model``. Each model has a number of class variables, 
each of which represents a database field in the model.  (cf:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/)

Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class -- e.g., ``CharField``
for character fields and ``DateTimeField`` for datetimes. This tells Django 
what type of data each field holds.

The name of each Field instance (e.g. question or pub_date) is the field's 
name, in machine-friendly format. You'll use this value in your Python code, 
and your database will use it as the column name.

Some Field classes have required elements. ``CharField``, for example, requires
that you give it a ``max_length``. That's used not only in the database schema, 
but in validation, as we'll soon see.

Finally, note a relationship is defined, using ``ForeignKey``. That tells Django each
``Choice`` is related to a single ``Poll``. Django supports all the common database
relationships: many-to-ones, many-to-manys and one-to-ones.

Activate The Models
------------------------

``models.py`` gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:

* Create a database schema (``CREATE TABLE`` statements) for this app.
* Create a Python database-access API for accessing ``Poll`` and ``Choice`` objects.

But first we need to tell our project that the polls app is installed.

#.  Verify that ``settings.py`` has ``polls`` as part of the ``INSTALLED_APPS``.  [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_added_polls>`]


Commit!
---------

Add and commit all your work.


Syncronise the Database
--------------------------

Now Django knows to include the polls app. 

#.  Examine the SQL produced by the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py sql polls

#.  Create the tables for the ``polls`` app.

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py syncdb

The syncdb looks for ``apps`` that have not yet been set up. To set them up, 
it runs the necessary SQL commands against your database. This creates all the 
tables, initial data and indexes for any apps you have added to your project since 
the last time you ran syncdb. syncdb can be called as often as you like, and it 
will only ever create the tables that don't exist.

`More info`: Read the django-admin.py `documentation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/>`_ for full information on what the manage.py utility can do.

Explore The Api
------------------------------

Now, let's hop into the interactive Python shell and play around with 
the free API Django gives you. To invoke the Python shell, use this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py shell

We're using this instead of simply typing "python", because manage.py sets 
up the project's environment for you. "Setting up the environment" involves two things:

#.  Making sure ``polls`` is on the right path to be imported.
#.  Setting the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable, which gives Django the path to your ``settings.py`` file.

Once you're in the shell, explore the database API:

#.  import the model classes we just wrote:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from polls.models import Poll, Choice

#.  list all the current Polls:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> Poll.objects.all()
        []

    How many polls is this?  


#.  `Zen koan:  Can there be a Choice for a Poll that doesn't yet exist?`

#.  Add a ``Poll``.

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> import datetime
         >>> p = Poll(question="What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?", pub_date=datetime.datetime.now())

#.  Save the ``Poll`` instance into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> p.save()

#.  Get the ``id`` of the Poll instance. Because it's been saved, it has an ID in the database

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> p.id
         1

#.  What other methods and attributes does this ``Poll`` instance have?

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> dir(p)
        >>> help(p)

#.  Access the database columns (Fields, in Django parlance) as Python attributes:

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> p.question
         "What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?"
         >>> p.pub_date
         datetime.datetime(2007, 7, 15, 12, 00, 53)

#.  Send the Poll back in time:

    .. code-block:: python

         # Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
         >>> p.pub_date = datetime.datetime(2007, 4, 1, 0, 0)
         >>> p.save()
         >>> p.pub_date
         datetime.datetime(2007, 4, 1, 0, 0)

#.  Ask Django to show a list of all the Poll objects available:

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> Poll.objects.all()
         [<Poll: Poll object>]

Fix The Hideous Default Representation
---------------------------------------------

Wait a minute!  ``<Poll: Poll object>`` is an utterly unhelpful, truly wretched, beyond comtemptable representation of this object. Let's fix that by editing the ``Polls`` model.
Use your ``text editor`` to open the polls/models.py file and adding a ``__unicode__()`` method to both ``Poll`` and ``Choice``::

    class Poll(models.Model):
        # ...
        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.question

    class Choice(models.Model):
        # ...
        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.choice

It's important to add ``__unicode__()`` methods to your models, not only for your own sanity when dealing with the interactive prompt, but also because objects' representations are used throughout Django's automatically-generated admin.  

(If you're using to Python programming from a time in the past, you might have seen ``__str__()``. Django prefers you use __unicode__() instead.)

#.  Enough of these `normal` python methods!  ::

     import datetime
     # ...
     class Poll(models.Model):
         # ...
         def was_published_today(self):
             return self.pub_date.date() == datetime.date.today()

    Note the addition of ``import datetime`` to reference Python's standard ``datetime`` module. This allows
    us to use the datetime library module in ``models.py`` by calling it with ``datetime``. To see what functions
    come with a module, you can test it in the interactive shell:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> dir(datetime)
        ['MAXYEAR', 'MINYEAR', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', 'date', 'datetime',
        'datetime_CAPI', 'time', 'timedelta', 'tzinfo']

#. Save these changes to the ``models.py`` file

#. Start a new Python interactive shell by running ``python manage.py shell``::

    >>> from polls.models import Poll, Choice

#. Verify our __unicode__() addition worked::

    >>> Poll.objects.all()
    [<Poll: What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?>]

#. Search your database using the ``filter`` method on the ``objects`` attribute of ``Poll``.


    >>> polls = Poll.objects.filter(question="What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?")
    >>> polls
    [<Poll: What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?>]
    >>> polls[0].id  # remember python lists start with element 0.
    1

    If you try to search for a poll that does not exist, ``filter`` will give you the empty list. The ``get`` method will always return one hit, or raise an exception.

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> Poll.objects.filter(question="What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?")
         []
         
         >>> Poll.objects.get(id=1)
         <Poll: What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?>
         >>> Poll.objects.get(id=2)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
         DoesNotExist: Poll matching query does not exist.

Add Choices
------------------------

#.  Observe, there is a Poll in the database, but it has no Choices.

     >>> p = Poll.objects.get(id=1)
     >>> p.choice_set.all()
     []

#.  Create three choices::

        >>> p.choice_set.create(choice='To Serve Man', votes=0)
        <Choice: To Serve Man>
        >>> p.choice_set.create(choice='The Original Road Kill Cookbook', votes=0)
        <Choice: The Original Road Kill Cookbook>
        >>> c = p.choice_set.create(choice='Mini-Mart A La Carte', votes=0)
        >>> c
        <Choice: Mini-Mart A La Carte>

#.  Go in reverse!  Find the poll a particular choice belongs to::

        >>> c.poll
        <Poll: What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?>

    Because a Poll can have more than one Choice, Django creates the ``choice_set`` attribute on each ``Poll``. You can use that to look at the list of available Choices, or to create them.

    .. code-block:: python

         >>> p.choice_set.all()
         [<Choice: To Serve Man>, <Choice: The Original Road Kill Cookbook>, <Choice: Mini-Mart A La Carte>]
         >>> p.choice_set.count()
         3

#.  No really.  Can one be a ``Choice`` for a ``Poll`` that doesn't yet exist?::

    >>> koan = choice("Is this even a choice")
    >>> koan.poll_id
    >>> koan.poll

Part 13:  Write Views With Power
======================================================

In Django, each view is responsible for doing one of two things: ``returning`` an ``HttpResponse`` 
object containing the content for the requested page, or ``raise``-ing an exception such 
as ``Http404``. What happens between Request and Response?  [:ref:`Magic! <webapp_answers_django_magical>`].  

Your view can read records from a database, or not. It can use a template system such 
as Django's -- or not. It can generate a PDF file, output XML, create a ZIP file on the fly, 
anything you want, using whatever Python libraries you want.

All Django wants is that at the end, it gets an ``HttpResponse`` or an ``exception``.

Most of the Django views in the world use Django's own database API, which was touched on
in the discuss of models.  (Sorry, I guess we can't forget about databases quite yet!)


#.  Construct a better ``index()`` view.  To match the spec, it should
    displays the latest 5 poll questions in the system, separated by commas, 
    according to publication date. 

    Edit ``views.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

         from polls.models import Poll
         from django.http import HttpResponse
         
         def index(request):
             latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
             output = ', '.join([p.question for p in latest_poll_list])
             return HttpResponse(output)

#.  Restart the dev server, and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/.
    You should see the text of the last 5 HEAVY METAL polls. 
    There's a problem here, though: The page's design is hard-coded 
    in the view. If you want to change the way the page looks, you'll have to edit this Python 
    code. 

#.  Use Django's template system to separate the design from Python:

    .. code-block:: python

         from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
         from polls.models import Poll
         
         def index(request):
             latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
             context = {'latest_poll_list': latest_poll_list}
             return render_to_response('polls/index.html', context)

    To recap what this does:

    * Creates a variable called ``latest_poll_list``. Django queries the database for ``all`` Poll objects, ordered by ``pub_date`` with most recent first, and uses ``slicing`` to get the first five.
    * Creates a variable called ``context`` that is a dictionary with one key.
    * Evaluates the ``render_to_response`` function with two arguments, and returns whatever that returns.

    ``render_to_response`` loads the template called ``polls/index.html`` and passes it a 
    value as ``context``. The context is a dictionary mapping template variable names to 
    Python objects.
    
    If you can read this this ``view`` function without being overwhelmed, then you understand 
    the basics of Django views. Now is a good time to reflect and make sure you do. 

    #. What would you have to change to get 10 polls?
    #. What if you wanted the first 10 *by name*?


#.  Reload http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/. Now you'll see an error:

    .. code-block:: bash

         TemplateDoesNotExist at /polls/
         polls/index.html

    Ah. There's no template yet. Let's make one.

#.  Make a ``polls/templates/poll`` directory where templates will live. 
    Right alongside the ``views.py`` for the ``polls`` app. This is what I would do:

    .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir -p polls/templates/polls

#.  Edit ``polls/templates/polls/index.html`` to contain.

    .. code-block:: html
        
         {% if latest_poll_list %}
             <ul>
             {% for poll in latest_poll_list %}
                 <li><a href="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/">{{ poll.question }}</a></li>
             {% endfor %}
             </ul>
         {% else %}
             <p>No polls are available.</p>
         {% endif %}

#.  Reload http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ . 
    You should see a bulleted-list containing some of the HEAVY METAL POLLS.
    There should also be link pointing to the poll's detail page.

#.  RE-RUN your tests.  Save and Commit.  

Fix The Detail View and Handle User Errors using a 404
--------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's tackle the poll detail view -- the page that displays the question for a
given poll. 

#. Edit the ``views.py`` file. This view uses Python ``exceptions``:

    .. code-block:: python

         from django.http import Http404
         # ...
         def detail(request, poll_id):
             try:
                 p = Poll.objects.get(id=poll_id)
             except Poll.DoesNotExist:
                 raise Http404
             return render_to_response('polls/detail.html', {'poll': p})

    Notice that view raises the ``Http404`` exception if a poll with the 
    requested ID doesn't exist.  

#.  Create ``polls/templates/polls/detail.html`` with:

    .. code-block:: html

        {{ poll }}

#.  Verify your "detail" view works. Try it: http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/

#.  Re-run your tests.  Note that we get in, we get a pesky 
    ``TemplateDoesNotExist: 404.html`` message.  Let's fix that!

    Create ``polls/templates/404.html`` (the polls template root dir) as::

        <p>You have a 404.  Go back and try again.</p>

#.  Save and commit.

#.  Load a poll page that does not exist, to test out the 
    pretty 404 error: http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/100000000000/

    #.  What?  It says DEBUG has to be False?  All right, set it, and 
        try again!

    #.  (note:  Chrome 'eats' the 404.  Safari will show our created page.)

    #.  Change DEBUG back to True

    #.  Re-run the tests, and show the ``TemplateDoesNotExist: 404.html``
        goes away.

    #.  Save and commit.

#.  **Discussion**:  raising a 404 here (Page Not Found) is meant to be 
    illustrative.  404 is a blunt tool.  In a real application, maybe we
    would redirect the user to the 'create a poll' page, or the search page.
    
    **Discuss** in your group what behaviour *should* happen in this case.
    
    #. Why did the user land here?
    #. What did they expect to find?
    #. What should happen next?


Add More Detail to the Details
---------------------------------------

#.  Add more detail to the ``detail`` view.

#.  Edit the ``polls/detail.html`` template to add a ``poll`` variable.
    ``poll``  points  the particular instance of the Poll class.

    .. code-block:: html

        <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>
        <ul>
        {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
            <li>{{ choice.choice }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>


#.  The ``djanogo.template`` system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. 
    Django's template language is a bit looser than standar python.
    In pure Python, the ``.`` (dot) only 
    lets you get attributes from objects, and we would need to use `[]` to 
    access parts of ``list``, ``tuple`` or ``dict`` objects. 
    In this example, we are just doing attribute 
    lookup, but in general if you're not sure how to get data out of an object in 
    ``django.templates``, try ``dot``.  

    Method-calling happens in the ``{% for %}`` loop: ``poll.choice_set.all`` is interpreted as the 
    Python code ``poll.choice_set.all()``, which returns a sequence of ``Choice`` 
    objects and is suitable for use in the ``{% for %}`` template tag.

#.  Reload http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/ .  Observe that the poll choices now appear.

#.  Save and commit your changes.

#.  *Detail yourself* to go *view* out a window, get a drink of water, and 
    let your eyes rest.  

    Yes, that means you!

Part 14:  Deploy Again
==========================

#.  Commit and Push.

#.  Refresh your project on DjangoZoom.

#.  Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/ .  Is there anything there?  Why not?

Takeaway:  Your local datastore (here, ``database.db``) is not present on
DjangoZoom, and the data here and there can (and will!) be different.


Part 15: Let the people vote
============================================

Create the form
-----------------

#.  Recall that the prototype spec allows users to vote up and vote down choices
    on polls.  We are going to use a *form* for that functionality.  As an 
    alternative, we could have used AJAX Requests, a special
    url ('/polls/11/choice/3/upvote') or some other mechanism.  

#.  Update our poll detail template (``polls/detail.html``) to contain
    an HTML <form> element:

    .. code-block:: html
        
        <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>
        
        {% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}
        
        <form action="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/vote/" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
            <input type="radio" name="choice" value="{{ choice.id }}" />
            <label>{{ choice.choice }}</label><br />
        {% endfor %}
        <input type="submit" value="Vote" />
        </form>

#. There is a lot going on there. A quick rundown:

    *   The above template displays a radio button for each poll choice. The value of each radio button is the associated poll choice's ID. The name of each radio button is "choice". That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, the form submission will represent the Python dictionary ``{'choice': '3'}``. That's the basics of HTML forms; you can learn more about them at your local library!

    *   We set the form's 

        * action to ``/polls/{{ poll.id }}/vote/``
        * ``method="post"``. 

        Normal web pages are requested using ``GET``, but the standards for HTTP indicate that if you are changing data on the server, you must use the ``POST`` method. (Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, use ``method="post"``. This tip isn't specific to Django; it's just good Web development practice!)

    *   Since we're creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don't have to worry too hard, because Django comes with a very easy-to-use system for protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the ``{% csrf_token %}`` template tag.

        The ``{% csrf_token %}`` tag requires information from the request object, which is not 
        normally accessible from within the template context. To fix this, a small adjustment 
        needs to be made to the detail view in the ``views.py`` file.

        #. Fix ``views.py`` to protect against CRSF hacking:

        .. code-block:: python
            
            from django.template import RequestContext
            from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render_to_response
            # ...
            def detail(request, poll_id):
                p = get_object_or_404(Poll, pk=poll_id)
                return render_to_response('polls/detail.html', {'poll': p}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))


    *   Notice we also added a function that checks if a ``404`` is returned for us.  
        This is a common pattern, so there is a pre-built shortcut function for it
        so we can use fewer lines of code! The details of how the ``RequestContext`` works are explained in the `documentation for RequestContext 
        <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#subclassing-context-requestcontext>`_

#.  Review your work at http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/ .

#.  Save and commit.


Process the form
-------------------

#.  Recall that our ``urls.py`` includes:

    .. code-block:: html

         (r'^(?P<poll_id>\d+)/vote/$', 'vote'),

#.  Recall also that we created a dummy implementation of the ``vote()`` function. 

#.  Create a real version of ``vote()``. Add the following to ``polls/views.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

         from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render_to_response
         from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect, HttpResponse
         from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
         from django.template import RequestContext
         from polls.models import Choice, Poll
         # ...
         def vote(request, poll_id):
             p = get_object_or_404(Poll, pk=poll_id)
             try:
                 selected_choice = p.choice_set.get(pk=request.POST['choice'])
             except (KeyError, Choice.DoesNotExist):
                 # Redisplay the poll voting form.
                 return render_to_response('polls/detail.html', {
                     'poll': p,
                     'error_message': "You didn't select a choice.",
                 }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
             else:
                 selected_choice.votes += 1
                 selected_choice.save()
                 # Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing
                 # with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a
                 # user hits the Back button.
                 return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('polls.views.results', args=(p.id,)))

    This code includes a few things we haven't covered yet in this tutorial:

    * ``request.POST`` is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name. In this case, ``request.POST['choice']`` returns the ``ID`` of the selected choice, as a string. ``request.POST`` values are always strings.  **POP QUIZ**:  Why is this?  
      [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_request_post_values_strings>`]

    * Note that Django also provides ``request.GET`` for accessing GET data in the same way -- but we're explicitly using ``request.POST`` in our code, to ensure that data is only altered via a ``POST`` call.

    * ``request.POST['choice']`` will raise ``KeyError`` if choice wasn't provided in ``POST`` data. The above code checks for ``KeyError`` and redisplays the poll form with an error message if choice isn't given.

    * After incrementing the choice counter, the code returns an ``HttpResponseRedirect`` rather than a normal ``HttpResponse``. ``HttpResponseRedirect`` takes a single argument: the URL to which the user will be redirected (see the following point for how we construct the URL in this case).

    As the Python comment above points out, you should always return an ``HttpResponseRedirect``
    after successfully dealing with POST data. This tip isn't specific to Django; it's just good Web 
    development practice. That way, if the web surfer hits ``reload``, they get the success page again,
    rather than re-doing the action.

    We are using the ``reverse()`` function in the ``HttpResponseRedirect`` constructor in this example. 
    This function helps avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function. It is given the name 
    of the view that we want to pass control to and the variable portion of the URL pattern that points
    to that view. In this case, using the URLconf we set up in ``urls.py``, this ``reverse()`` call will return a string like

    .. code-block:: bash

          '/polls/3/results/'

    where the ``3`` is the value of ``p.id``. This redirected URL will then call the ``results`` view to display
    the final page. Note that you need to use the full name of the view here (including the prefix).


#.  RUN YOUR TESTS.  What is still failing?  Not much!  I hope!

#.  Write the ``result`` view, which will redirect to the results page for the poll. 
    Augment ``views.py``.

    ..  code-block:: python

        def results(request, poll_id):
             p = get_object_or_404(Poll, pk=poll_id)
             return render_to_response('polls/results.html', {'poll': p})

    This is almost exactly the same as the ``detail()`` view we wrote earlier.  
    The only difference is the template name. We'll can fix this redundancy later.

#.  Create a ``/polls/templates/polls/results.html`` template:

    .. code-block:: html
        
        <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>
        
        <ul>
        {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
            <li>{{ choice.choice }} -- {{ choice.votes }} vote{{ choice.votes|pluralize }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        
        <a href="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/">Vote again?</a>
        

#.  Restart your dev server.

#.  Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/ in your browser and vote in the poll. You should see a results page that gets updated each time you vote.

#.  Verify that if you submit the form without having chosen a choice, 
    you should see a warning message.  Why does this happen?  
    [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_django_magical>`]  Nah, just funnin'! 
    [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_missing_choice>`]

#.  RE-RUN TESTS!  They should *all pass* at this point.

#.  Save and commit:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # in myprojects
        git status
        git add  <some files> # whatever files need adding!
        git commit -m "protoype complete.  all tests pass."
        git push origin master


Part 16: Editing your polls in the Django admin interface
=============================================================

So far, you've been adding data to your database using the ``manage.py shell``.
This is a flexible way to add data, but it has some drawbacks:

* It's not on the web.
* A fanatical insistence on precision: You have to write Python code to add data, which means that typos or syntax errors could make your life harder.
* An unnecessary lack of color.

Background: Django's built-in admin interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change and delete content is 
tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely 
automates creation of admin interfaces for models.

Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between 
“content publishers” and the “public” site. Site managers use the system to add news 
stories, events, sports scores, etc., and that content is displayed on the public site. 
Django solves the problem of creating a unified interface for site administrators to edit content.

The admin isn’t necessarily intended to be used by site visitors; it’s for site managers.

Activate the admin site
------------------------------------

The Django admin site is not activated by default – it’s an opt-in thing. 

#.  Activate the admin site for your installation:

    #.  Open up ``myproject/settings.py`` and uncomment "django.contrib.admin" and "django.contrib.admindocs" in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
    #.  Edit ``myproject/urls.py`` file and uncomment the lines that reference the admin – there are four lines in total to uncomment.

        .. code-block:: bash

            from django.contrib import admin
            admin.autodiscover()
            
            # and
            (r'^admin/doc/', include('django.contrib.admindocs.urls')),
            (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

    #.  Since you have added a new application to INSTALLED_APPS, the database tables need to be updated:

        .. code-block:: bash

            python manage.py syncdb


Restart the development server
---------------------------------------------

Let’s make sure the development server is running and explore the admin site.

Try going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. If it does not load, make sure you are 
still running the development server. You can start the development server like so:

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py runserver

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ should show you the admin site's login screen.


Enter the admin site
---------------------------------

Now, try logging in. (You created a superuser account earlier, when running ``syncdb`` for 
the fist time. If you didn't create one or forgot the password you can create another one.) 
We suggested ``super`` ``super`` as the name and password earlier :)  


You should see a few other types of editable content, including groups, users and sites. 
These are core features Django ships with by default.


Make the poll app modifiable in the admin
----------------------------------------------------------------

But where's our poll app? It's not displayed on the admin index page.

Just one thing to do: We need to tell the admin that Poll objects have an admin
interface.

#.  Create ``polls/admin.py``, and edit it to look like this:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        from polls.models import Poll
        from django.contrib import admin
        
        admin.site.register(Poll)
        

#.  Restart the dev server.   
    
    Normally,  the server auto-reloads code every time you modify a file, but the action of
    creating a new file doesn't trigger the auto-reloading logic. You can stop it by 
    typing ``Ctrl-C`` (``Ctrl-Break`` on Windows); then use the ``up`` arrow on your
    keyboard to find the command again, and hit enter.

Explore the free admin functionality
-------------------------------------------------------

Now that we've registered Poll, Django knows that it should be displayed on the admin index page.

#.  Click "Polls." Now you're at the "change list" page for polls. This page displays all the polls 
    in the database and lets you choose one to change it. There's the "What is the Weirdest Cookbook Ever?" poll we created in the first tutorial.

    Things to note here:

    * The form is automatically generated from the ``Poll`` model.
    * The different model field types (``DateTimeField``, ``CharField``) correspond to the appropriate HTML input widget. Each type of field knows how to display itself in the Django admin.
    * Each ``DateTimeField`` gets free JavaScript shortcuts. Dates get a "Today" shortcut and calendar popup, and times get a "Now" shortcut and a convenient popup that lists commonly entered times.

    The bottom part of the page gives you a couple of options:

    * Save -- Saves changes and returns to the change-list page for this type of object.
    * Save and continue editing -- Saves changes and reloads the admin page for this object.
    * Save and add another -- Saves changes and loads a new, blank form for this type of object.
    * Delete -- Displays a delete confirmation page.

#.  Change the "Date published" 

    #.  the "Today" and "Now" shortcuts. 
    #.  click "Save and continue editing."
    #.  click "History" in the upper right. You'll see a page
        listing all changes made to this object via the Django admin, with the timestamp and 
        username of the person who made the change

Adding related objects
-----------------------------------

OK, we have our ``Poll`` admin page. But a ``Poll`` has multiple ``Choices``, and the admin 
page doesn't display choices.

Yet.

There are two ways to solve this problem. The first is to register Choice with the 
admin just as we did with Poll. That's easy:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from polls.models import Choice
    
    admin.site.register(Choice)
    

Now "Choices" is an available option in the Django admin. Check out the ``Add Choice`` form.

In that form, the "Poll" field is a select box containing every poll in the database. 
Django knows that a ``ForeignKey`` should be represented in the admin as a ``<select>``
box. In our case, only one poll exists at this point.

Also note the "Add Another" link next to "Poll." Every object with a ``ForeignKey``
relationship to another gets this for free. When you click "Add Another," you'll get a
popup window with the "Add poll" form. If you add a poll in that window and click 
"Save," Django will save the poll to the database and dynamically add it as the selected
choice on the "Add choice" form you're looking at.

But, really, this is an inefficient way of adding Choice objects to the system. It'd be better 
if you could add a bunch of Choices directly when you create the Poll object. Let's make 
that happen.

#.  Remove the register() call for the Choice model. 

#.  Edit the ``polls/admin.py``  to read:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        from polls.models import Poll
        from django.contrib import admin
        
        class ChoiceInline(admin.StackedInline):
            model = Choice
            extra = 3
        
        class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            fieldsets = [
                (None,               {'fields': ['question']}),
                ('Date information', {'fields': ['pub_date'], 'classes': ['collapse']}),
            ]
            inlines = [ChoiceInline]
        
        admin.site.register(Poll, PollAdmin)
        

    This tells Django: "Choice objects are edited on the Poll admin page. 
    By default, provide enough fields for 3 choices."

#.  Restart your development server

#.  Load the "Add poll" page to see how that looks

    It works like this: There are three slots for related Choices
    -- as specified by extra -- and each time you come back to
    the "Change" page for an already-created object, you get another three extra slots.

Customize the admin change list
--------------------------------------------------

Now that the Poll admin page is looking good, let's make some 
tweaks to the admin "change list" page -- the one that displays
all the polls in the system.

By default, Django displays the ``str()`` of each object. 
But sometimes it'd be more helpful if we could display
individual fields. To do that, use the ``list_display`` admin 
option, which is a tuple of field names to display, as 
columns, on the change list page for the object:

.. code-block:: python
    
     class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
         # ...
         list_display = ('question', 'pub_date')
    

Just for good measure, let's also include the ``was_published_today`` 
custom method from way back in the **models** part of this workshop:

.. code-block:: python

    class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        # ...
        list_display = ('question', 'pub_date', 'was_published_today')
    

#.  Examine the polls list.

    You can click on the column headers to sort by those values -- 
    except in the case of the ``was_published_today`` header, because 
    sorting by the output of an arbitrary method is not supported. 
    Also note that the column header for ``was_published_today`` is, 
    by default, the name of the method (with underscores replaced with spaces). 

    This is shaping up well. 

#.  Add some search capability. Add this to ``class PollAdmin``:

    .. code-block:: python
         
         class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
         # ...
             search_fields = ['question']

    That adds a search box at the top of the change list. When somebody 
    enters search terms, Django will search the question field. You can use 
    as many fields as you'd like -- although because it uses a LIKE query 
    behind the scenes, keep it reasonable, to keep your database happy.

#.  Add drill-down by date.  Because Poll objects have dates, 
    it'd be convenient to be able to drill down by date. Add this line:

    .. code-block:: python
        
         class PollAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
         # ...
             date_hierarchy = 'pub_date'

    That adds hierarchical navigation, by date, to the top 
    of the change list page. At top level, it displays all available 
    years. Then it drills down to months and, ultimately, days.


#.  **Discuss as a group**   Polls app vs. admin

    * which is better?
    * what features do each have that the other lack?
    * which was easier to code?
    * which has cleaner code?
    * [:ref:`answer <webapp_answers_polls_vs_admin>`]


#.  That's the basics of the Django admin interface.  Employ it liberally!

#.  Relax, and bask in self-satisfaction.
