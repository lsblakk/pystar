Python Tutorial Badge
=====================

If you want a more formal and more in depth introduction to Python, the `Python Tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`_ fits the bill. Written by the Benevolent Dictator For Life himself, `Guido van Rossum <http://www.python.org/~guido/>`_, it covers many of Python's noteworthy features.

You will almost certainly not complete the whole tutorial in one day. Do as much as you want or have time for, have fun, and ask questions!
