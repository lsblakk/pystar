Command Line Navigation Badge
================================

This badge is to learn how to navigate using the command line (CLI).

    .. note:

        The command line is case sensitive. 

Commands
--------

Commands used when navigating in the CLI:

* cd
* ls
* mkdir
* pwd

Concepts
---------

Navigation requires an understanding of the above commands and of file system paths, both relative and absolute.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
....................................

Absolute paths are the full name to a file or directory starting from root.

If I want to navigate to a folder in my Documents folder (on a Mac), the absolute path would look something like::

    $ cd /Users/Amanda/Documents/Thesis/

It's all relative
..................

Relative paths are partial path names relative to where you are in the directory structure.

If I am in ``/Users/Amanda``, then the way to get to my Thesis folder using the relative path would look something like::

    $ cd Documents/Thesis

If I am in my Thesis folder and I want to move to a different folder within my Documents directory, I would do something like::

    $ cd ../IF

The double dot notation is shorthand for "go up a directory," which is this case is Documents. From there, I can then go down into my IF directory (and play some text adventure games).

Here is a more complicated example: from my IF directory, I could get to a folder of pictures in my Pictures directory (absolute path: /Users/Amanda/Pictures/atlanta) by typing::

    $ cd ../../Pictures/atlanta/

The first ``..`` takes me up to Documents, the second ``..`` takes me up to my user directory (Amanda) and from there I can go down into Pictures and then into atlanta.

Open a command line window. Explore your file system in the CLI using the following commands and using absolute and relative path names:

* ls
* pwd
* cd

``ls`` means "list" and it will show you the list of files in the directory you are in. Try using some optional arguments such as ``-a``, ``-p``, or ``-l``. What do they show you that just running ``ls`` without arguments doesn't?

``pwd`` means "print working directory," which is fairly self explainitory. Try typing it in different directories. What does it return?

``cd`` means "change directory," which is also fairly self explainitory. Try typing in ``cd`` by itself. Where does it bring you? Try navigating to a directory within your files system and list the files in that directory. Use absolute and relative paths to visit several different directories on your file system.

Here's an example of what your CLI screen might look like after completing the above work:

.. code-block:: bash

    amanda-nyrens-macbook-pro:~ Amanda$ pwd
    /Users/Amanda
    amanda-nyrens-macbook-pro:~ Amanda$ ls
